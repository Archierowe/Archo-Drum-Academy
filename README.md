# ARCO DRUM ACADEMY WEBSITE

## DESCRIPTION

After many years playing and teaching Drums, I had always wanted to focus on a way to bring it together in one place. Arco Drum Academy is that place and it's a place
that offers unrivalled facilities and teachers that are passionate about playing and about seeing others succeed and have joy through pursuing their musical goals - 
whether that's simply learning to play for home or for stage  - all students are treated equally. 

Arco Drum Academy is a vision that is in the making - albeit on a smaller scale than one imagined here. However, who knows what the future holds!

It is presented across five pages that give a balanced and exciting overview of the company and brand.

-   Home: Gives the vision of Arco - an exciting place to come and learn drums.
-   About: Explains the ethos, values and vision of Arco Drum Academy. Also presents some of the founder's previous work, the aim here is showcasing experience and professionalism.
-   What we offer: This page contains all relevant information about what a user can get from Arco - easy and comprehensive presentation with obvious links to what is on offer and how to book lessons.
-   Book a lesson: Easy to navigate page for lesson bookings. Aim is to make it intuitive for the user - all done through submitting info and booking a lesson through calendly. User has opportunity to ask questions. 
-   Masterclasses: Site users can come to Arco Drum Academy and listen to and importantly, learn from world-famous drummers. Easy booking form through calendly form and again, opportunity to ask questions. 


## UX

### Brand and visual identity

The aim of the visuals was clean, professional and obvious. The Logo created was intended to be instantly recognisable as a Drum tuition school. 

There is much attention to detail throughout. The visual tone is intended to display professionalism and precision - projecting these themes and welcoming everyone to come, experience the same, and be a part of that journey.

The [home](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/index.html) page contains striking visuals of a video of a live show of the founder with stark text conveying the values and aims of Arco Drum Academy. 

Overall, the visual flow of the site is intended to be simple, visually pleasing and intuitive with the home page as the anchor.

### User stories

The site is designed primarily for people who want to learn to play drums - from those who have never picked up sticks before to those who have experience of playing. 
The hope is that beginners and experienced players all find something they want to experience, to get involved with and it's all under one roof. 

#### Potential customers:

-   As a potential customer, I want to know what Arco Drum Academy is and who the teaching is aimed at (e.g. if I am a beginner what can they offer, if I am experienced what will I get out of it?)
-   As a potential customer, I want an easy way to see what the Academy offers; from how much lessons are, to booking those lessons and if events happen at the Academy. I also might want to ask questions and be able to contact Arco Drum Academy with enquiries - by phone and email.
-   As a potential customer, I wish to know who the teacher(s) are and what experience they have - why should I study there?
-   As a potential customer, I want to get an idea as to what the facilities look like and the atmosphere of the studios.

These questions are answered in the following ways:

-   The home page is designed to be alluring, attractive and simple - it explains the goals and vision of the company, who it is for, where we are located - with a simple nav bar.
-   Potential customers can see all that the Academy offers in more than one way: through the "What we offer" button on the [Home](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/index.html) page, and by accessing information through the nav bar to the 'What we offer', 'Book a lesson' and 'Masterclasses' pages - where potential customers can input email and ask questions. Information such as contact details for the academy are also located in the footer.
-   The [What we offer](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/what-we-offer.html) page  gives a detailed overview of what Arco Drum Academy is all about from lesson pricing, to info for beginners and those who wish to learn from famous drummers.
-   The [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) page is easy to use - with a calendly link for bookings and a form to ask questions should they so wish.
-   The [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) page is easy to navigate - the same layout as Book a lesson for user continuity - only exception is a drop-down to select a masterclass which brings another calendly link for bookings.
-   The about page gives a comprehensive and personal look at the founder, his experience and his vision for the academy and for students. Links to previous work gives users the opportunity to 'experience' the professional work of the founder and enhances the credibility of the drum tutor(s)/teacher(s) and academy as a whole.
-   Images throughout the site give potential customers/students the opportunity to see inside the studios, which enhances the offering - if a potential customer can see facilities, then they can become more excited at the prospect of being a part of it all.


### User Experience

The site was created to be a visually appealing yet easily accessible and intuitive user experience across all devices. The site acts responsively based on screen-size - for example some buttons turn off to decrease the amount of moving between screens - a toggler appears on mobile to provide a visually appealing navbar experience. 

Colour schemes were intended to be muted, with bold white lettering to give a clean appearance. 

Use of the division of thirds was used in the information-based pages (What we offer, Book a lesson and Masterclasses) so that a user is drawn to essential information yet has a visually appealing experience.


## WIREFRAME

A detailed wire frame was designed to ensure the organisation and flow of content for desktop and mobile versions of the website.

The final version of the wireframe can be found [here](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/arco-wireframe.pdf)


## FEATURES

Numerous features were used with the intention of giving a simple and intuitive, yet pleasant user experience.

-   I used a sitewide alert to point to sale information for the user - with a clickable link to take them to the Book a lesson page - easy and simple to use.
-   Fade In/Down welcome text on the home page, intended to draw the user into the site, creating a visually pleasing experience. 
-   Background video on home page - intention to create an experience for the user - to draw them into the 'live' feel of playing in a studio. Visual appeal.
-   The use of buttons throughout the site - intended to take the user clearly and simply to the areas of interest. Simple, intuitive navigation. 
-   The use of a YouTube video and MP3 player gives the user direct access to the 'sound of the Academy' - gives them the opportunity to experience and be drawn in to the atmosphere of Arco Academy. 
-   The calendly links give quick and visual access to the lessons and masterclasses available to them for immediate planning and accessibility - giving the user control over bookings and enquiries.

The site uses various features, many of which are native to bootstrap:

-   Forms and question boxes - such as those seen on Book a lesson and Masterclass pages. 
-   Buttons  - site wide use of buttons.
-   Modal windows on [What we offer](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/what-we-offer.html) page to display information about lessons for beginners.
-   Modal windows on [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) page to display calendly link to book lessons.
-   Modal windows on [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) page to display calendly link to book slots for masterclasses.
-   On mobile devices some buttons disappear and content text (from about page) disappears to allow for a more fluid user experience.
-   Flexbox classes used to keep content fixed, regardless of content size.

### FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT

-   Ideally, I would have liked to have produced/designed features that gave a more 'tactile' experience - buttons that made sounds or given some nods to drum sound effects. 
    However, this meant using languages that were outside of the scope of this project - Javascript for example. 

## TESTING

![Arco Drum Academy website on different screensizes](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/wireframes/devices-display.png)

The site was tested on various platforms to ensure it displays across different screen sizes.

Form validation was tested on both the [Book a lesson](https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/book-a-lesson.html) and [Masterclasses](https://https://archierowe.github.io/Archo-Drum-Academy/masterclasses.html) pages. This was done to ensure that the Calendly links worked well across all formats and that when a user asks a question it is sent to the business. 

### Gif to illustrate how the Book a lesson works

-   User clicks on book a lesson button.
-   This takes them to the Calendly select a day - a date then which they can select.
-   this then takes them to selecting a time on the selected day.
-   They then enter their contact details and a question (if they have one).
-   They can then select close.

### Gif to illustrate what happens when a question is submitted

-   User enters personal details on the Book a lesson page and enters a question (email is required).
-   The details are then sent to external source (in this case Formspree).
-   Users enquiry arrives at email source (in this case my gmail),

The HTML and CSS was validated on [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and speed tested on [Pingdom](https://www.pingdom.com/)

### Issues, challenges and bugs

-   Numerous challenges presented themselves through the addition of the live video loop. I attempted to originally implement through a linear-gradient background. Due to my inexperience I attempted this as a 'background image'.
    After many attempts to make this work I found a very helpful solution by way of custom CSS which allowed for the video to be looped - courtesy of [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp). I also was not able to 
    'fade' the background video to enable the intro/welcome text to really 'pop'. This was eventually achieved through applying a filter in CSS.
-   It took many attempts to get the calendly link integrated into a button - this was achieved by trial and error of positioning of the divs and it led to a deeper understanding of placement.
-   When testing the variety of browsers that needed to support the site, I have realised my home page does not always display properly. I had limited my initial 'build testing' to the Chrome Dev Tools - especially when checking code for breakpoints and differing screen sizes. It hadn't occurred to me to run it on actual devices. I now have a much greater appreciation of this going forward.
-   I need to get more to grips with Flexbox as had some issues understanding how to implement into existing HTML.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

-   Many thanks to [Felipe Alarcon](https://github.com/felipe-alarcon) for his invaluable help, feedback and encouragement (legend)!
-   Thank you also to the Code Institute's slack community for always responding to my requests for "Help!" and what seemed like silly questions at times!
-   A thank you to [Bootstrapious](https://bootstrapious.com/) for a wealth of design ideas to look through - gave the idea for the FadeIn/Down text on the home page.
-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp) - such a great library of training videos and 'try it yourself' sections - very helpful!
-   I spent, probably, too many hours staring at the [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) site due to many google searches trying to figure out how to implement all the ideas floating around my head at 'too-late-O'clock' - most of which never made it to the end product.
-   My wife, for continually supporting and encouraging me in this new adventure. She also brought endless tea and coffee (and treats) which 'fuelled' those late night sessions.
