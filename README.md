# Arco Drum Academy

## DESCRIPTION

After many years playing and teaching Drums, I had always wanted to focus on a way to bring it together in one place. Arco Drum Academy is that place and it's a place
that offers unrivalled faciilites and teachers that are passionate about playing and about seeing others succeed and have joy through pursuing their musical goals - 
whether that's simply learning to play for home or for stage  - all students are treated equally.

It is presented across five pages that give a balanced and exciting overview of the company and brand.

## DEPLOYMENT AND LIVE DEMO

The site has been deployed to github and is accessible on [github pages]().

## UX

### Brand and visual identity

The aim of the visuals was clean, professional and obvious. The Logo created was intended to be instantly recognisable as a Drum tuition school. 

There is much attention to detail with the visual tone intended to display artfulness and precision - projecting themes of professional players welcoming everyone to come and experience the same and be a part of that.

The home page contains striking visuals of a video of a live show of the founder with stark text conveying the values and aims of Arco Drum Academy. 

The visua flow of the site is intended to be simple, visually pleasing and intuitive.

### User stories

The site is designed primarily for people who want to learn to play drums - from those who have never picked up sticks before to those who have experience of playing. 
The hope is that beginners and experienced players all find something they want to get involved with, under one roof. 

#### Potential customers:

-   As a potential customer, I want to know a bit about Arco Drum Academy and who the teaching is aimed at (e.g. if I am a beginner what can they offer, if I am experienced what will I get out of it?)
-   As a potential customer, I want an easy way to see what the Academy offers; from how much lessons are, to booking those lessons and if events happen at the Academy. I also might want to ask questions and be able to contact Arco Drum Academy with enquiries - by phone and email.
-   As a potential customer, I wish to know who the teacher(s) are and what experience they have - why should I study there?
-   As a potential customer, I want to get an idea as to what the facilites look like and the atmosphere of the studios.

These questions are answered in the following ways:

-   The home page is designed to be alluring, attractive and simple - it explains the goals and vision of the company, who it is for, where we are located - with a simple nav bar.
-   Potential customers can see all that the Academy offers in more than one way: through the "what we offer" button on the home page, and by accessing information through the nav bar to the 'What we offer', 'Book a lesson' and 'Masterclasses' pages.
-   The 'What we offer' page gives a detailed overview of what Arco Drum Academy is all about from lesson pricing, to info for beginners and those who wish to learn from famous drummers.
-   The book a lesson page is easy to use - with a calendly link for actual bookings and a form to ask questions should they so wish.
-   Masterclasses page is also an easy to navigate page - the safe layout as Book a lesson for user continuity - only exception is a drop-down to select a masterclass.
-   The about page gives a comprehensive and personal look at the founder, his experience and his vision for the academy and for students. Links to previous work gives users the opportunity to 'experience' the professional work of the founder and enhances the credibility of the drum tutor(s)/teacher(s) and academy as a whole.
-   Images throughout the site give potential customers/students the opportunity to see inside the studios, which enhances the offering - if a potential customer can see facilities then they can become mroe xcitedat the propect of being a part of it all.


### User Experience

INPUT HERE, THE SITE ACROSS ALL DEVICES - PICS

The site was created to be a visually appealing yet easily accesible and intuitive user experience across all devices. The site acts responsively based on screen-size - for example some buttons turn off to decrease the amount of moving between screens - a toggler appears on mobile to provide a visually appealing navbar experience. 

Colour schemes were intended to be muted, with bold white lettering to give a clean appearance. 

Use of the divison of thirds was used in the information based pages (What we offer, Book a lesson and Masterclasses) so that a user is drawn to essential information yet has a viually appealing experience.


## WIREFRAME

A detailed wire framing process was undertaken to oversee the structure of the site and ensure proper organization of content on desktop and mobile versions of the site.

The final version of the wireframe can be found [here]


## FEATURES

Numerous features were used with the intention of giving a simple and intuitive, yet pleasant, user experience.

-   I used a sitewide alert to point to sale information for the user - with a clickable link to take them to the Book a lesson page - easy and simple to use.
-   Fade In/Down welcome text on the home page, intented to draw the user into the site, creating a visually pleasing experience. 
-   Background video on home page - intention to create an experience for the user - to draw them into the 'live' feel of playing in a studio. Visual appeal.
-   The use of buttons throughout the site - intended to take the user clearly and simply to the areas of interest. Simple, intuitive navigation. 
-   The use of a YouTube video and MP3 player gives the user direct access to the 'sound of the Academy' - gives them the opportunity to experience and be drawn in to the atmosphere of Arco Academy. 
-   The calendly links give quick and visual access to the lessons and masterclasses available to them for immediate planning and accesibility - giving the user control over bookings and enquiries.


The site uses various features many of which are native to bootstrap:

-   Forms and question boxes - such as those seen on Book a lesson and Masterclass pages.

-   Flexbox classes used to keep keep content fixed, regardless of content size.
